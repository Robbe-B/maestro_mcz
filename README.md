## Functionality

This integration aims to use the same API as the app to enable control via Home Assistant.

Currently it provides a Climate entity and a temperature sensor as an initial release.

Since this integration is still in the beta stage, breaking changes might occur from time to time.

There are a couple of milestones set. Feel free to check them out at [Milestones](https://github.com/Robbe-B/maestro_mcz/milestones)
